  "body": "### Integration of GMT with QGIS Processing as an algorithm provider\r\nGMT (Generic Mapping Tools) provides a set of several spatial algorithms that are suitable for some geosciences subjects like surface generations from points suitable for gravity data, generation of points like Focal Mechanisms symbols for earthquakes sources representations, generations of rasters for hillshade representation from topographical surfaces, among others.\r\n\r\nIntegration of these spatial algorithms in QGIS Processing will bring to the geoscience and GIS communities, a complete set of tools for Mapping Generation and Data Analysis,  helping to fill the gap between those communities by providing them a common toolset.\r\n\r\n### Background Information\r\nOur work will be based on the PyQGIS API, QGIS Processing framework, GMT algorithms, and the GMTPy wrapper. We want to help link both worlds, geosciences and GIS and make QGIS a reference tool for a variety of communities around the world.\r\n\r\nGMT Project Site:\r\nhttp://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/\r\n\r\nGMTPy Site:\r\nhttp://emolch.github.io/gmtpy/\r\n\r\n### Gallery of samples\r\nWe would like to highlight some examples of the powerful GMT map generation:\r\n\r\nDistances from Rome to the world: ![distances, Rome](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_23.png)\r\n\r\nSurface: ![Surface, Interpolation, GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_05.png) \r\n\r\n3-D perspective mesh plot: ![3D, Mesh, Perspective](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_04.png) \r\n\r\nStacked profile: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_33.png \r\n\r\nImage over topographic map: ![Topography, GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_32.png) \r\n\r\nWorldwide earthquake activity: ![Earthquakes activity](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_22.png )\r\nWorld languages by continent: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_10.png \r\n\r\n3-D Histogram: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_08.png \r\n\r\nAnimations: (Would require looping over map generation changing parameters) http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/anim_04.gif \r\n\r\nHistograms: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.2.1/_images/example_06.png\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis Project will be done with the support and contributions of @remyalex and @gacarrillor, active users of GIS community.\r\n",
